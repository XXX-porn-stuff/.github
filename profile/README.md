## Hi there 👋

### Prerequisites

Bocking ads, popups, redirects and all this annoying things is essential.
I prefered HOSTS based blocking on Windows and rooted Androids..
Recently i switched back to NO-ROOT on Android.
Non-Root solutions involve a local VPN mostly, which for me is a no-go to work with on a daily basis.
On Windows i noticed that a reasonable good blocking HOSTS file gets realky huge,
which slowed down my good old Windows 8.1 machine to a non- usable state.
